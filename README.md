# ArduinoPlayDohPiano
This project uses the CapacitiveSensor library on Arduino to detect the human touch on a PlayDoh (modeling clay). Since the most abundant compost in PlayDoh is the Sodium, it makes these clays really conductible. I created this project beacuse I am passionate about programming and I like to take new challenges. The idea of programming, learning and having fun makes everything easier.

The <a href=http://playground.arduino.cc/Main/CapacitiveSensor?from=Main.CapSense>CapacitiveSensor library</a> allows the arduino to detect a variation in current according to two analog pins. These pins must be connected using a resistor. Any touch in this connection may lead to a current and voltage variation. This variation differential can be used to a lot of interesting stuff with the arduino.

This project uses this variation in order to detect a human touch, similar to a smartphone touchscreen. The system can be composed of many PlayDoh keys, each one of them representing a musical tone.

In order to run this project, it is necessary to have an Arduino Board and the ArduinoIDE installed. For this project, I used the Arduino Mega.

```sh
  I will add a video of the project running soon.
